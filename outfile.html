<span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">emma</span> woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a <span style="font-size:22px;">comfortable</span> home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence and had lived nearly twenty one <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">years</span> in the world with very <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">little</span> to distress or vex her <br/>
she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most <span style="font-size:24px;">affectionate</span> indulgent <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">father</span> and had in <span style="font-size:22px;">consequence</span> of her sister s marriage been mistress of his <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">house</span> from a very early period <br/>
her mother had died too <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">long</span> ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">little</span> short of a mother in <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">affection</span> <br/>
sixteen <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">years</span> had <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">miss</span> <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">taylor</span> been in <span style="color:#a1cbd9;font-weight:bold;">mr.</span> woodhouse s family less as a governess than a <span style="color:#a1cbd9;font-weight:bold;">friend</span> very fond of both daughters but <span style="font-size:24px;">particularly</span> of <span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">emma</span> <br/>
between them it was more the intimacy of sisters <br/>
even before <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">miss</span> <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">taylor</span> had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being now <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">long</span> passed away they had been living together as <span style="color:#a1cbd9;font-weight:bold;">friend</span> and <span style="color:#a1cbd9;font-weight:bold;">friend</span> very mutually attached and <span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">emma</span> doing just what she liked highly esteeming <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">miss</span> <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">taylor</span> s judgment but directed chiefly by her own <br/>
the real evils indeed of <span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">emma</span> s situation were the power of having rather too <span style="color:#73919b;font-weight:bold;">much</span> her own way and a disposition to think a <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">little</span> too well of herself these were the <span style="font-size:26px;">disadvantages</span> which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments <br/>
the danger however was at present so unperceived that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her <br/>
sorrow came a gentle sorrow but not at all in the shape of any <span style="font-size:24px;">disagreeable</span> <span style="font-size:26px;">consciousness</span> <br/>
<span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">miss</span> <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">taylor</span> married <br/>
it was <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">miss</span> <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">taylor</span> s loss which <span style="color:#45575d;font-weight:bold;">first</span> brought grief <br/>
it was on the wedding <span style="color:#45575d;font-weight:bold;">day</span> of this beloved <span style="color:#a1cbd9;font-weight:bold;">friend</span> that <span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">emma</span> <span style="color:#45575d;font-weight:bold;">first</span> sat in mournful <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">thought</span> of any <span style="font-size:22px;">continuance</span> <br/>
the wedding over and the bride people gone her <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">father</span> and herself were left to dine together with <span style="color:#73919b;font-weight:bold;">no</span> prospect of a third to cheer a <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">long</span> evening <br/>
her <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">father</span> composed himself to sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost <br/>
the event had <span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">every</span> promise of happiness for her <span style="color:#a1cbd9;font-weight:bold;">friend</span> <br/>
<span style="color:#a1cbd9;font-weight:bold;">mr.</span> <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">weston</span> was a <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">man</span> of <span style="font-size:30px;">unexceptionable</span> character easy fortune suitable age and pleasant manners and there was some <span style="font-size:24px;">satisfaction</span> in <span style="font-size:22px;">considering</span> with what self denying generous friendship she had <span style="color:#45575d;font-weight:bold;">always</span> wished and promoted the match but it was a black morning s work for her <br/>
the want of <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">miss</span> <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">taylor</span> would be felt <span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">every</span> hour of <span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">every</span> <span style="color:#45575d;font-weight:bold;">day</span> <br/>
she recalled her past kindness the kindness the <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">affection</span> of sixteen <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">years</span> how she had taught and how she had played with her from five <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">years</span> old how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood <br/>
a large debt of gratitude was owing here but the intercourse of the last seven <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">years</span> the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed isabella s marriage on their being left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer <span style="font-size:24px;">recollection</span> <br/>
she had been a <span style="color:#a1cbd9;font-weight:bold;">friend</span> and companion such as few possessed: intelligent well informed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family interested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself in <span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">every</span> pleasure <span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">every</span> scheme of hers one to whom she <span style="color:#e62236;font-weight:bold;">could</span> speak <span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">every</span> <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">thought</span> as it arose and who had such an <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">affection</span> for her as <span style="color:#e62236;font-weight:bold;">could</span> never find fault <br/>
how was she to bear the <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">change</span> it was true that her <span style="color:#a1cbd9;font-weight:bold;">friend</span> was going only <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">half</span> a mile from them but <span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">emma</span> was aware that great <span style="color:#73919b;font-weight:bold;">must</span> be the difference between a mrs. <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">weston</span> only <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">half</span> a mile from them and a <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">miss</span> <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">taylor</span> in the <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">house</span> and with all her advantages natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering from <span style="font-size:24px;">intellectual</span> solitude <br/>
she dearly loved her <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">father</span> but he was <span style="color:#73919b;font-weight:bold;">no</span> companion for her <br/>
he <span style="color:#e62236;font-weight:bold;">could</span> not meet her in <span style="font-size:24px;">conversation</span> rational or playful <br/>
the evil of the actual disparity in their ages and <span style="color:#a1cbd9;font-weight:bold;">mr.</span> woodhouse had not married early was <span style="color:#73919b;font-weight:bold;">much</span> increased by his <span style="font-size:24px;">constitution</span> and habits for having been a <span style="font-size:28px;">valetudinarian</span> all his life without activity of mind or body he was a <span style="color:#73919b;font-weight:bold;">much</span> older <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">man</span> in ways than in <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">years</span> and though everywhere beloved for the <span style="font-size:24px;">friendliness</span> of his heart and his amiable temper his talents <span style="color:#e62236;font-weight:bold;">could</span> not have recommended him at any time <br/>
her sister though <span style="font-size:26px;">comparatively</span> but <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">little</span> removed by matrimony being settled in london only sixteen miles off was <span style="color:#73919b;font-weight:bold;">much</span> beyond her daily reach and many a <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">long</span> october and november evening <span style="color:#73919b;font-weight:bold;">must</span> be struggled through at hartfield before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband and their <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">little</span> children to fill the <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">house</span> and give her pleasant society again <br/>
highbury the large and populous village almost amounting to a town to which hartfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies and name did really belong afforded her <span style="color:#73919b;font-weight:bold;">no</span> equals <br/>
the woodhouses were <span style="color:#45575d;font-weight:bold;">first</span> in <span style="font-size:22px;">consequence</span> there <br/>
all looked up to them <br/>
she had many <span style="font-size:24px;">acquaintance</span> in the place for her <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">father</span> was universally civil but not one among them who <span style="color:#e62236;font-weight:bold;">could</span> be accepted in lieu of <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">miss</span> <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">taylor</span> for even <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">half</span> a <span style="color:#45575d;font-weight:bold;">day</span> <br/>
it was a melancholy <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">change</span> and <span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">emma</span> <span style="color:#e62236;font-weight:bold;">could</span> not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things till her <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">father</span> awoke and made it necessary to be cheerful <br/>
his spirits required support <br/>
he was a nervous <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">man</span> easily depressed fond of <span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">every</span> body that he was used to and hating to part with them hating <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">change</span> of <span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">every</span> kind <br/>
matrimony as the origin of <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">change</span> was <span style="color:#45575d;font-weight:bold;">always</span> <span style="font-size:24px;">disagreeable</span> and he was by <span style="color:#73919b;font-weight:bold;">no</span> means yet reconciled to his own daughter s marrying nor <span style="color:#e62236;font-weight:bold;">could</span> <span style="color:#45575d;font-weight:bold;">ever</span> speak of her but with compassion though it had been entirely a match of <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">affection</span> when he was now obliged to part with <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">miss</span> <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">taylor</span> too and from his habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to suppose that other people <span style="color:#e62236;font-weight:bold;">could</span> feel <span style="font-size:22px;">differently</span> from himself he was very <span style="color:#73919b;font-weight:bold;">much</span> disposed to think <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">miss</span> <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">taylor</span> had done as sad a thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield <br/>
<span style="color:#b8e8f8;font-weight:bold;">emma</span> smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she <span style="color:#e62236;font-weight:bold;">could</span> to keep him from such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner poor <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">miss</span> <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">taylor</span> i wish she were here again <br/>
what a pity it is that <span style="color:#a1cbd9;font-weight:bold;">mr.</span> <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">weston</span> <span style="color:#45575d;font-weight:bold;">ever</span> <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">thought</span> of her <br/>
i cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot <br/>
<span style="color:#a1cbd9;font-weight:bold;">mr.</span> <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">weston</span> is such a good humoured pleasant excellent <span style="color:#5c747c;font-weight:bold;">man</span> that he thoroughly deserves a good wife and you would not have had <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">miss</span> <span style="color:#145c74;font-weight:bold;">taylor</span> live with us for <span style="color:#45575d;font-weight:bold;">ever</span> and bear all my odd humours when she might have a <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">house</span> of her own <br/>
a <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">house</span> of her own but where is the advantage of a <span style="color:#8aaeba;font-weight:bold;">house</span> of her own <br/>
